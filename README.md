#Setting up Kubernetes Pods as Jenkins Agents


Install the Kubernetes plugin for Jenkins. This can be done by navigating to "Manage Jenkins" > "Manage Plugins" > "Available" and searching for "Kubernetes".

Configure the Kubernetes plugin by providing it with the details of your cluster, such as the Kubernetes URL and credentials.

Create a Jenkinsfile that defines a Jenkins pipeline. Within this pipeline, you can use the "podTemplate" step to define the container and resources needed for your agents.

Create a Jenkins job that uses the Jenkinsfile you just created. You can configure the job to run on the Kubernetes agents by selecting "Kubernetes" as the label for the "Restrict where this project can be run" option.

Once the job is configured, run it and verify that the pipeline completes successfully on the Kubernetes agents.
